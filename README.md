# London-Housing-Price

## Project Conclusion
In general, the housing price has grown a lot in London. Specifically, Hounslow, Richmond upon Thames, Harrow have the lowest growing rate in housing prices. From 1988 to 2018, the housing price increased by approximately 300%. Hackney has the highest growing rate in housing price which increased by morethan 500%;

## The Data Science Pipeline
Four stages of Data Science Pipeline:

- Sourcing and loading
- Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing
- Modeling
- Evaluating and concluding

## Challenges
This project will make use of only what you learned in the following courses: 
- Prework courses (Introduction to Python for Data Science, Intermediate Python for Data Science)
- Data Types for Data Science
- Python Data Science Toolbox (Part One) 
- pandas Foundations
- Manipulating DataFrames with pandas
- Merging DataFrames with pandas
